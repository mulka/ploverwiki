### Why does Plover exist?

Falling numbers of graduates from steno schools and the high attrition
of retiring stenographers initially caused [Mirabai Knight](http://StenoKnight.com)
to worry about the
future of her profession, as inferior non-verbatim systems (e.g., ER,
Typewell, C-Print, automated speech recognition) threaten to fill in the
supply vacuum caused by a shortage of steno professionals. At the same
time, she saw steno's great potential in helping to improve the lives of
the large number of people who work in front of computers all day,
whether they're writing prose, creating software, entering data, or
communicating in text with friends and coworkers. As a method of text
entry, Qwerty is inefficient and unergonomic, but so far it hasn't been
supplanted by any of the competing systems (such as
[Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) or
[Colemak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Colemak)),
because they're simply not powerful enough to justify the time
investment necessary to learn them. Steno, on the other hand, is. So
Plover has a double-pronged approach: Find people who want to learn
steno, whether just as amateurs or as aspiring professionals, and give
them a cheap, simple, and fun way to try it out; then, for those few who
find that they've got both a gift and a passion for steno, provide an
opportunity to turn that skill into a career, feeding the talent pools
for future professional stenographers and ensuring that steno as a
profession will survive into the future.

### Why does steno need amateurs?

In most skill-based fields -- music, photography, athletics, and
computer programming, to name a few -- a healthy pool of amateurs makes
it possible for professionals to exist. People cultivate an interest,
buy some cheap equipment, take a few classes, discover that they love
the work, hone their skills with thousands of hours of practice, and
eventually a very dedicated and talented few are able to become good
enough to make a living at what they love. The rest do it without
compensation, just for their own pleasure and enjoyment. This is the
natural ecosystem of any difficult skill: A wide base of dabblers and
dilettantes at the bottom, and a small number of world class hotshots at
the top. Without a steady supply of amateurs to hold the ranks, it's
difficult for professionals to exist. Many legendary musicians started
out with a $50 guitar and a tattered songbook. If every guitar cost
$5,000 and the only way to learn how to play it was at a conservatory,
how many potentially great guitarists would never even get within
strumming range? Plover reduces the $1,500+ initial startup cost of
steno to around $70, which means vastly more people can give it a try
and see if it might be for them.

### What is Steno Arcade?

[Steno Arcade](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2016/03/steno-arcade-campaign-is-live.html)
is an arcade game suite that The Plover Project wants to make. It will
hopefully teach and drill steno skills in a way that's fun, fast-paced,
and addictive. It's not yet in production, but the planning stages are
underway. Stay tuned. Meanwhile, several free steno drilling tools are
available, such as:

* [StenoTutor](https://github.com/caru/StenoTutor)
* [Steno Practice](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~tthurman/practice.html)
* [StenoTyper](http://stenoknight.com/plover/stenotyper/test3.html)
* [Fly](https://launchpad.net/flyploverfly)

### Is Steno Arcade going to put steno schools out of business?

Very unlikely. There will always be a place for high-speed dictation and
one-on-one interaction between steno professionals and students. Hover
Plover will be directed at people who want to use steno
non-professionally, aren't sure whether steno is for them, or who want
to try it out a bit before committing to making it a definite career
goal. There will always be some autodidacts who can get through the
Steno Arcade program entirely by themselves and find themselves
certification-ready at the end of it, but that will probably be fairly
rare.

### Is Plover going to put CAT software companies out of business?

Definitely not. Plover is not court reporting software. It has no
transcript preparation utilities of any kind. It was designed by someone
who's never made a court or deposition transcript, and would have no
idea where to start. However, it might prove useful to people who use
other CAT systems for their work but would like to use Plover as a
replacement for their qwerty keyboard in daily computing tasks. At some
point Plover might become a solid option for CART providers, but there
are no plans to make it into CAT replacement software for either court
reporters or broadcast captioners.

### What are some features in Plover not commonly found in most CAT software?

Plover's main purpose is to replace the qwerty keyboard with a steno
keyboard. Unlike other CAT systems, it does not have a text entry
window; it's a pure conduit straight to the operating system. Anything
you can do with a qwerty keyboard can be done with Plover, and you can
use it with the word processor or text editor of your choice. Plover
runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its length-based buffer, as opposed to
the time-based buffer used in most CAT software, ensures instant
delivery of text with no buffer flushing or time delay. Its dictionary
is text-based, so you can search through and edit it using any text
editor. Updating the dictionary from the writer is smooth and seamless.
And, of course, its biggest feature: It's 100% free and open source. You
can download it, keep it on a USB key, and have it to hand as a backup
in case something happens to your CAT software. You can distribute it to
interested friends and potential steno students. You can run it on as
many computers as you like, with absolutely no restrictions. And, if you
know how to program in Python, you can modify it and change it to your
heart's delight.

### Which steno machines are compatible with Plover?

See the [[supported hardware|Supported Hardware]] page. In summary, Plover supports many common steno machines that you may own, but critically also supports using a regular computer keyboard and mapping a subset of its keys to the steno layout. This lets users try out stenography without needing to purchase a steno machine!

### Is an NKRO keyboard as fast as a steno machine?

No. It's definitely clunkier and squishier than a genuine lever-based
steno machine, and a certain amount of accuracy and speed is necessarily
sacrificed because of that. It's also somewhat more fatiguing, because
it requires more force to press the keys and their travel depth is
deeper than most modern steno machines. However, it's perfectly possible
for a trained stenographer to reach speeds of 220 WPM or higher using something like a
Sidewinder X4, especially if they have the optional laser-cut steno
keytoppers ([$20 from the Plover store](http://plover.deco-craft.com/shop/view_product/Laser_Cut_Steno_Keys_Kit?n=2910988)):

### How many people currently use Plover?

Hard to say, since people are free to download and distribute the
software as much as they want without asking permission. However, the
[Plover Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ploversteno)
currently has 578 members.

### What theory is Plover's default dictionary based on?

It's basically Mirabai's personal dictionary, which is a mix of New York
Career Institute theory and Sten Ed, with several thousand tweaks,
briefs, and additions of her own. Plover works with dictionaries in
rtf/cre format, exportable from just about any CAT software.
