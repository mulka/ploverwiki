# Brief

Also known as the "abbreviation", "short form", or "arbitrary".  Briefs
are simply non-phonetic mappings of steno outlines to English words or
phrases. For instance, the phrase "from time to time" could be written
out:

`FROM/TAOIM/TO/TAOIM` *(Four strokes)*

Or it could be briefed:

`FRIMT` *(One stroke)*

# Chord

The pressing down of multiple keys at the same time.

# Dictionary

Used by Plover or other stenotype software. Contains all the words and
the strokes that produce those words. While generally these are
constructed using a [[steno theory|Glossary#steno-theory]], this can be freely modified by the
stenographer.

# Steno Theory

A "system" or way of thinking that determines which steno strokes will
match to which words. Theories range generally from being based on
spelling (or "brief-heavy") to being based on the sound of the word (or
"stroke-heavy"). The one included with Plover is based on NYCI theory
which descended from StenEd.

# Word Boundary

The implicit spacing in between words. Spacing is inserted automatically
by Plover or other steno software. As words and phrases will often sound
similar to others, a stenographer needs to choose the stroke or brief
appropriate for the situation with the correct word boundary.

Examples (Plover):

* "in here" ("**TPH**/HAOER") vs "insect" ("**EUPB**/SEBGT")
* "on top of" ("**OPB**/TOP/-F") vs "onto" ("**AUPN**/TO")
* "it is a live (wire)" ("T/S/**AEU**/HREUF") vs "it is alive" ("T/S/**A**/HRAOEUF")
