Here are some ideas for strokes in briefs that you can consider incorporating into your personal dictionary.

# `-FR` for -m

Usually, one uses `-PL` for the -m sound in the end of a syllable. It can be difficult to add sounds after the -m. One can use `*PL` to denote -mp, but this still falls short when you want sounds after the 'p'.

Common uses of this are to add -mpl or -mbl to the end of a stroke:

* `AFRP` for "amp" and `AFRPL` for "ample".
* `TKPWRUFRBL` for "grumble".

# `SPW-` for int- and ent-

This comes from Magnum steno. There are some entries in the default dictionary that use `SPW-`, although it's not documented in [Learn Plover]. Examples:

* `SPWEPBLGT` for "intelligent".
* `SPWRABGT` for "interact".
* `SPWAOEURL` for "entirely".

# `SKP-` for ex-

The default dictionary uses a combination of `KP-` and `S-` to make the leading ex- sound (such as `KPEUT` for "exit" for `SPHRAEUPB` for "explain"). The rules for which one to use [depend on the consonant following the ex-](ex-rules). If you don't like this, you can use `SKP-` for a leading ex-:

* `SKPRAGT` for "extract".
* `SKPERPBL` for "external".
* `SKPHRAEUPB` for "explain".

Note that the leading `SKP-` is also used for some phrase briefs starting with "and" in the default dictionary, such as `SKPEBG` for "and he can" and `SKPALS` for "and also". If this is a problem for you, you can also try `SK*` instead of `SKP-`.

# `KPW` for im- and em-

Examples:

* `KPWRES` for "impress".
