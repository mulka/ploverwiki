Plover has some useful tools that can show information while you're using it, or to make changes to its configuration or to the dictionaries. Here's a list of some of them. A list of tools you can turn on is shown in the toolbar at the top of Plover's main window.

<!-- TODO: make formatting of button and checkbox names consistent. Right now, the long ones use quotes and the short ones use italics, but that may look a bit odd. -->

## Configure Plover

The configuration window is used to change settings like which keys on the keyboard are mapped to which virtual keys in the steno system. It also lets you change whether the first word written after starting Plover is capitalized and whether it has a space before it, among other things.

## Paper tape

Useful to see which keys Plover thinks you're pressing. It keeps a list of strokes shown so you can see what you've written. It doesn't show strokes made before you enabled it though. This feature can be set to be enabled every time Plover starts by opening the configuration window and checking the "show paper tape" checkbox in the interface tab.

## Stroke suggestions

When you write words, this tool can look up the words you write and show how they can be written. Like the paper tape, it doesn't show words written before you write them, and it scrolls automatically every time a word is added. It can be enabled to be on when Plover starts by checking the "show suggestions" checkbox in the interface tab of the configuration window.

## Plugins

The plugins manager lets you install plugins. In the top of its window, there's a list of plugins. To install any of them, first select the tool and then click the _Install/Update_ button. To uninstall a plugin, select it and click _Uninstall_. Some changes can't take effect until you restart Plover.

Some plugins are themselves tools.
