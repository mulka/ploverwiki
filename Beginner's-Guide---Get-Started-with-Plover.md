This guide explains how to get started with Plover.

## Overview

The main steps are:

1. Install Plover software.
1. Connect a compatible keyboard or stenography machine.
1. Confirm it's working ("Hello World").
1. Practice and learn stenography using Plover. 

## Install Plover

There are versions of Plover for Windows, OS/X and Mac OS, and Linux. 

* Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases/latest). 
* See the [installation guide](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Installation-Guide#installation) for more information.

### Configuring Plover on OS/X and Mac OS

On OS/X and Mac OS, you will need to enable [Assistive Device Permissions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202866) each time you install Plover (`System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`). Other "keyboard helper" type applications (like Karabiner Elements) may interfere with Plover. 

## Connect a compatible keyboard or stenography machine

You don't need to buy a $3,000 steno machine in order to learn stenography using Plover. 

###Use a standard keyboard

You can use Plover with a standard keyboard, but there are some important limitations. 
Stenography often requires you to press five or six keys at once, and sometimes as many as 16. Unfortunately, most keyboards only recognise up to six keys at once. When you need to press more than six keys are once, you have to use a technique called "arpeggiating". See [How it Works](http://qwertysteno.com/Basics/HowItWorks.php) for more information on arpeggiating.

This means, before long, you'll need a keyboard with N-key rollover (NKRO). Most gaming ("mechanical") keyboards have this capability.

### Use an N-key rollover (NKRO) keyboard

An N-key rollover (NKRO) keyboard is specially designed to allow pressing many keys at once. 

* The [Zalman ZM-K600S](https://www.amazon.com/Zalman-Unlimited-Multi-Key-keyboard-ZM-K600S/dp/B0196J3IPE) is currently the cheapest option in the USA, at $45-50.

See the [[Supported Hardware]] page for a list of supported keyboards. 

#### Keytoppers

Most keyboards have the keys in staggered rows, which can make it difficult to press two keys in a column with a single finger. To solve this problem, you can use keytoppers, which are in the shape of the keys on a steno machine, and stick them on top of the relevant keys on the keyboard.  

You can buy laser-cut keytoppers from the [Plover Store](http://plover.deco-craft.com/). You can also make your own keytoppers out of plastic. 

#### Keyboards with an ortholinear layout

Keyboards with an "ortholinear" layout have the keys in straight columns. This is handy for steno, as it makes it easier to press two keys in a column with a single finger. 

* The [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) is a fairly high-end keyboard at $200, with an ortholinear layout. It has two separate halves, so you can angle them to suit you. You can order it with the Gateron White keys, which have a light, 35 gram activation force.
* The [Planck](http://olkb.com/planck/) keyboard has an ortholinear layout, and is 60% smaller than a standard keyboard.

### Use a machine designed for use with Plover

Various steno enthusiasts are making and selling machines designed for use with Plover:

* [Stenomod](http://stenomod.blogspot.com/). This has light keys and a split design. Ted Morin, Plover lead developer,  [wrote an review](http://www.teds.space/2016/10/stenomod-affordable-steno-machine.html).
* [SOFT/HRUF](https://softhruf.love/). This has the shape of a stenography machine, but is built using computer keys rather than levers. Ellis Pratt wrote a [review comparing it with the Stenomod](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ploversteno/iraOYarRbdg/tlHeagOQGQAJ).
* [StenoBoard](http://stenoboard.com/)

### Use a professional stenography machine
 
Some professional stenography machines are compatible with Plover. 

You can find used steno machines on eBay at reasonable prices. The most common/popular of these seems to be the Stentura 400 SRT.

See [[Supported Hardware]] 

## Confirm it's working ("Hello World")

By default, Plover will use your keyboard as input. Steno often needs you to press many keys at once, and most keyboards won't handle that, but you can still write quite a few words. Run Plover and click the `Enable` radio button. Move your fingers up from the home row so that they rest on the cracks between the keys, and move your thumbs up so they rest on the cracks between `C`/`V` and `N`/`M`. Try out these [sentences that (mostly) only need two keys at once](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/two-key). You may like to go into Plover's `Configure > Display` settings and turn on either the stroke display or the suggestions window.

### Practice and learn

While there are many competing steno theories for the English language (Magnum, Phoenix, etc.) they all share the same keyboard design and basic method of representing the sounds. They differ mostly in the details of how they abbreviate words, and how many abbreviations they use. And everyone ends up adapting them and forming a personal style anyway.

So you don't need to worry about choosing a theory until you hit 100 WPM or so. It's fine to start with Plover's middle-of-the-road StenEd-based theory. After 3-6 months you'll have a better feel for things and you can start experimenting with different theories.

Plover has an excellent introductory textbook, [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/home), and [Steno Jig](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/) lets you drill on the exercises. [[Learning Resources]] and [the old steno practice page](http://stenoknight.com/wiki/Practice) list other tools.
