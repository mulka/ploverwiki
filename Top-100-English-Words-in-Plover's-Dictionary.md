# Top 100 Words in Plover's Dictionary

What they are and why they are like that.

## Introduction

When learning steno theory, you might be confused by the fact that many common words are not written out phonetically. There are many reasons that this is the case, but it boils down to:

- Avoiding word boundary errors
- Ease of stroking

## The List

### 1. the

The most common word in the English language is reserved to just one key, right-hand `-T`. The right hand position makes it easy to combo as the second word in many combination phrases, for example `SKP-T` for "and the".

### 2. be

Right-hand `-B`. The "B" key in Plover just happens to be the "be" key. How convenient! Writing out "be" like `PWE` is the word part "be^", like in "beware" or "belated". And the phonetic `PWAOE` is "bee"!

### 3. to

Written out by spelling, `TO`. Easy to hit and free of conflicts. Warning: `O` for "to" in the default dictionary is a misstroke and is not free from word boundaries.

### 4. of

Right-hand `-F`. Simple one key stroke, and frees up `OF` to be used for "off".

### 5. and

`SKP-`. An easy to hit stroke with only the left hand, making it a good candidate for starting phrases, like `SKPU` for "and you".

### 6. a

`AEU`. Rather than just `A`, which is used as a prefix for words like "affix" or "arrive". The tense A sound is used to avoid conflicts. In some theories, these strokes are mixed, and you could likely safely swap them if you wanted.

### 7. in

`TPH` is just the left-hand `N`. This combination frees up `EUPB` to be used for the "in^" prefix like in 
"indoors". Also good for phrases, such as `TPH-T` for "in the".

### 8. that

`THA`. We drop the ending T to bring this stroke into the left hand for use at the beginning of phrases. Examples: `THAR` for "that are", `THAS` for "that is".

### 9. have

`SR-`; left-hand `V`. The phonetic version of this would be `HA*F` which is much harder to stroke for such a common word, and the left-hand makes right-hand phrase parts feel more natural, like `SR-T` for "have the".

`HAF` and `HA*F` get mapped to "half" and "1/2" in the default dictionary, respectively.

### 10. I

`EU`; the `I` chord. This is a nonphonetic stroke to give space for "eye". It's easy to hit and fits in some phrases, such as `SKPEU` for "and I". Note that, in some cases, you will use the `AOEU` cluster for I, such as in "I'll" (`AOEUL`) and "I'm" (`AOEUPL`) because the shorter versions are used for other things, in this case "ill" and the word beginning "im^".

### 11. it

Left-hand `T-`, easy to hit and on the left hand for beginning phrases such as `TWAS` for "it was". Same pattern as for "in" and "if".

### 12. for

`TP-R` (F-R). Drops the vowel to save effort for such a common word. If you want to use "for^" the prefix, then use `FAUR`. For example, forgone is `FAUR/TKPWOPB`.

### 13. not

`TPHOT`

### 14. on

`OPB`

### 15. with

`W-`. Another easy to use single key stroke that can begin phrases like `WOUR` for "with our" and `W-T` for "with the".

### 16. he

`HE`, stroke given by spelling. Recommended over the `E`-only version for most cases, but depending on the phrase or word you might need `E` (`SKPE`: and he), `HE` (`HEBGD`: he could), and `HAOE` (`HAO*EL`: he'll)

### 17. as

`AS` (spelling) or `AZ` (phonetic)

### 18. you

`U`. The `U` key is used for "you". Can be used in phrases such as `SKPU` for "and you".

### 19. do

`TKO` (spelling). Don't drop the vowel, because `TK-` alone is used for "did".

### 20. at

`AT`

### 21. this

`TH`. "This" is a special case, as it's basically set to `TH` for convenience and to open up the opportunity for several other briefs. For example, `THEU` is used for "think", and `THEUS` follows as "thinks".

Also works in phrases: `TH-FS` for "this was"

### 22. but

`PWUT` or `PWU`. Mirabai uses `PWUT` as "but" and that is okay, but you can safely remap `PWUT` to "but the" if you want to use `PWU` as "but" exclusively.

### 23. his

`HIS` (spelling), `HIZ` (phonetic)

### 24. by

`PWEU`. Nonphonetic mapping to make room for `PWAOEU`: "buy". Add an asterisk to "by" and get the word beginning "bi^", add an asterisk to "buy" and get "bye".

### 25. from

`TPR-` (`F-R`). Similar to "for" (`TP-R`), but instead of dropping just the vowel, we drop the ending -M sound as well. This opens up "from" to phrases, like in `TPRUS` for "from us" and `TPR-T` for "from the" and `TPREUPHT` for "from time to time".

### 26. they

`THE`. Since "the" is stroked with just `-T`, we can place "they" in this stroke. It's important not to use `THAEU` to avoid potential conflict when we get to "they're" and "their".

### 27. we

`WE` (spelling) or `WAOE` (phonetic)

### 28. say

`SAEU` (phonetic).

Advanced: Also present as a right-hand only shortcut as `-BZ`, such as `THEBZ` for "they say". Get the past tense with `-BS` such as `THEBS` for "they said".

### 29. her

`HER`

### 30. she

`SHE` (spelling) or `SHAOE` (phonetic)

### 31. or

`OR`. The phonetic version is given instead to "other" (`OER`).

### 32. an

`APB`

### 33. will

`HR-`, left-hand L. Useful for phrases, such as `HR-B` for "will be" and `HRU` for "will you".

### 34. my

`PHEU` or `PHAOEU`. We break phonetic convention to offer an easier to hit stroke.

### 35. one

`WUPB` (phonetic)

### 36. all

`AUL` (phonetic). This vowel is common in the Plover dictionary, such as in `WAUL` (wall) and `PWAUL` (ball).

### 37. would

`WO`. Left-hand-only brief is useful for phrases: `WOB` for "would be" and `WOU` for "would you".

### 38. there

`THR-`. This brief is used to avoid conflict with `THER` for "they're" and `THAEUR` for "their".

### 39. their

`THAEUR` (phonetic). The homophone "they're" is stroked with `THER` which is the brief `THE` for "they" with `-R` added on.

### 40. what

`WHA`. Similar to `THA` for "that", `WHAT` is "what the".

### 41. so

`SO` (spelling)

### 42. up

`UP`. Use `AUP` for the word beginning "up^" like `AUP/WARDS` for "upwards".

### 43. out

`OUT`. Use `AOUT` for the word beginning "out^" like `AOUT/SPOEBG/*EN` for "outspoken" or `AOUT/RAEUPBLG` for "outrage".

### 44. if

`TP-`. The bare left F is used for "if". Good as a phrase beginner, such as `TP-T` for "if the". Same pattern as "it" and "in".

### 45. about

`PW-`. The left-hand B is used for "about" as a convenient brief. Some theories do this word differently. One nice benefit of being on the left side is, of course, phrases: `PW-T` for "about the".

### 46. who

`WHO` (spelling). We can't use `HAOU` (hue) or `HAO` (hoo).

### 47. get

`TKPWET` or `TKPW-T`

### 48. which

`WEU`. Just a brief.

### 49. go

`TKPWO` (spelling), `TKPWOE` (phonetic), or just `TKPW`.

### 50. me

`PHE` (spelling), `PHAOE` (phonetic). As with many of these common words, being less strict on the vowel gives your fingers a potential break.

### 51. when

`WH` (brief) or `WHEPB` (spelling)

### 52. make

`PHAEUBG` (`MAIK`) (phonetic)

### 53. can

The left-hand `K-` only, useful for phrases. `K-B` (can be).

`HEUPL`

### 59. know

`TPHOE` (phonetic)

### 61. people

`PAOEPL`. In this case `-PL` is used for the "pl" sound instead of `-M`.

### 62. into

`TPHAO`. `TPH-` is "in", and `AO` is sometimes used for `oo` which sounds liked the vowel in "into". Can't use `TPHAOU` as it is being used by "knew".

### 63. year

`KWRAOER` (phonetic)

### 64. your

`KWROUR` (spelling). Don't use `KWRUR` as that's the word ending `^ur` like in `KHROES/KWRUR` (closure).

### 65. good

`TKPWAOD`

### 66. some

`SOPL`. As a word beginning, `S-` and `SPH-` are used: for example, `SPH-PB` for "someone" and `S-G` for "something".

### 67. could

`KO`. Brief like `WO` for "would".

### 68. them

`THEPL`

### 73. now

`TPHOU`

### 74. look

`HRAOBG`

### 75. only

`OEPBL`. In Plover's dictionary, `E` is often added to strokes to make them end with an "ee" sound. `OEPBL` can be thought of as "onl/ee". Lots of briefs use this, such as `KRAER` for "contrary" and `TPAEPL` for "family".

### 76. come

`KOPL`

### 77. its

`EUTS`. `T-S` is used for "it's".

### 78. over

`OEFR`. Emphasizing the tense-O sound to contrast with `OFR` for "offer". To use as a prefix, use `AUFR`, such as `AUFR/TKOPB` for "overdone".

### 79. think

`THEU` (brief), with a whole family: `THEUS` for "thinks", `THEUG` for "thinking".

### 80. also

`HR-S` (brief)

### 81. back

`PWABG`

### 82. after

`AF`. `AFT` is a misstroke entry which you could consider remapping to "aft" or "after the". To use as a prefix, use `AFR`, such as `AFR/TAEUFT` for "aftertaste".

`AOUS` or `AOUZ`

### 84. two

`TWO` (spelling)

### 85. how

`HOU`

### 94. because

`PWAUS` or `PWAUZ` (briefs)

### 98. day

`TKAEU` (phonetic)
