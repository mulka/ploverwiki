## What you need

You will need two cables:

1. **Data Cable:** 
USB to RS-232 DB9 Male Serial Cable. (Make sure the chord has a male serial with 9 pins)
- [Amazon link](http://a.co/9KWXIMP)
2. **Power Cable:**
USB 2.0 Cable - A-Male to B-Male. (Your machine may come with this. Mine did not. Ideally, the USB cable could carry data too but modern drivers are not available.)
- [Amazon link](http://a.co/fQDbqWD)

Note: Both of those amazon links are for 6 foot cables. Make sure you get a cord long enough for your setup.

## Setup

Step 1. 
Connect serial-to-USB cable to your Stentura machine and to your computer. 

Step 2. 
Connect USB A-to-B cable to your Stentura machine and your computer.
