Stenography was traditionally taught in schools, and still is today. However, because of Open Steno, there are increasingly self-taught stenographers. Plover has everything you need to teach yourself stenography.

## Tutorial / Textbook / Drills

### Stenography theory

These sites aim to teach you steno theory, from the layout to the terminology to the strokes.

- [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/home)

    Learn Plover! is a free online textbook by Zack Brown, based on his steno tutoring sessions with Mirabai Knight. It offers a step-by-step introduction to Plover for beginners, with practice material at the end of every chapter. The accompanying exercises are available online in several places, notably Steno Jig and Typey Type. See the [Practice writing using stenography](#practice-writing-using-stenography) section.

- [The Art of Chording](https://www.artofchording.com/)

    The Art of Chording is a textbook that aims to guide the student through their stenography learning by providing a broad amount of knowledge from the first lesson on. The goal is to get students writing real words and sentences as quickly as possible and then delve into the minutiae of how to write with Plover's default dictionary quickly and without conflict. It includes additional sections on approaches borrowed from other steno theories that can be found in Plover's default dictionary.

### Practice writing using stenography

- [Qwerty Steno](http://qwertysteno.com/Home/)

    Qwerty Steno is a fantastic resource which has a tutorial on steno theory written by Mike Neale of the Open Steno community.

- [Steno Jig](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/)

    Steno Jig has a wide variety of words, sentences, etc that you can practice with optional stroke suggestions. There are several beginner drills, and a large set of vocabulary words, and sentence practice drills that you can work through to gradually learn the top 8,000 most used words. It has [Learn Plover! drills](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/learn-plover.html) with stroke hints and lookahead display.

- [Typey Type for Stenographers](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/)

    Type Type for Stenographers is a drilling and learning resource with a fair amount of practice material and detailed quantitative feedback. It includes lessons that follow the [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/home) book and lets you [upload your own practice material](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/lessons/custom/setup). It also has [dictionaries](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/dictionaries), [flashcards](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/flashcards), [recommendations](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/progress) on how much of which lesson to do next, a [break timer](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/break), a [lookup tool](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/lookup), and a [diagram generator](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/writer).

- [Plover Dojo](http://ploverdojo.appspot.com/)

    A lovely visual approach to learning the keyboard and basic chords, using a standard QWERTY keyboard, by JR, Jay Liu, and Myrntillae Nash.

- [Top 100 Words in Plover's Dictionary](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Top-100-English-Words-in-Plover's-Dictionary)

    Just a small tutorial covering the top 100 English words according to Wikipedia. Many of them are briefs and this text gives some insight as to why these strokes are the way they are.

- [ROPE: Remembering Outlines in Plover more Easily](https://github.com/kburchfiel/rope)

   This resource (now in version 3.0) offers a spreadsheet and two Anki decks to help users learn and remember outlines for over 4,000 common English words and over 1,000 common English phrases. The single-word deck also includes around 2750 mnemonic 'stories' that can make it easier to recall less intuitive outlines. ROPE features added-in outlines that allow users to write all words and phrases in ROPE in one stroke. In addition, these outlines allow users to write all words in the single-word deck in 5 keypresses or less, and the top 1000 root words in 4 keypresses or less. 

  The document was prepared by a non-professional steno user and may not be 100% accurate, but the lists will be corrected periodically. The ROPE spreadsheet, Anki file, readme, and custom dictionary can all be found on the GitHub page linked to above.

## Tools

You might consider enabling some of the [[built-in tools]], especially the paper tape so you can see which keys Plover thinks you're pressing. Once you're familiar with the layout and can write things the way they're pronounced and fingerspell those you can't, you might also want to enable the strokes suggestions tool.

## Dictation

If you want to eventually caption speakers, you will need to be able to take dictation.

- [Steno Arcade](http://store.steampowered.com/app/449000/)
   Steno Arcade is a project funded by the Open Steno Project, developed by [For All To Play](http://www.foralltoplay.com/). It contains Steno Hero, a game where you write lyrics in time with a singer and get graded on accuracy. You can create custom song files for use in the game by using [wavelyric](http://timothyaveni.com/wavelyric/).

- YouTube

   YouTube videos will offer a good start for dictation. You can find [dictations on YouTube](http://www.stenotube.com/category/5/Practice+Dictation), as well as material designed for ESL students, and speeches by your favorite speaker.
- Television

   Try captioning your favorite TV show once you are able to. Nature documentaries are especially good for beginners because they tend to have long pauses between dialogue.
- [Pitman London](http://www.pitmanlondon.co.uk/shorthandspeed/)

   Pitman London has a page of dictation for people learning pen shorthand. The dictation ranges in speed from 40WPM to 130WPM.
- [Court Reporting Help](http://courtreportinghelp.com/)

   CRH has some free dictation posts. Especially useful is the [Magic Drill](https://web.archive.org/web/20181107020646/http://courtreportinghelp.com:80/2016/01/02/magic-drills-free-audio-speed-drills/), for beginners and experts alike.
- [englishlearning.webgarden.es](http://englishlearning.webgarden.es/menu/1st-and-2nd-eso-year/easy-reading-texts)

   This repository of ESL resources has some simple texts with slow dictation. In particular, "Easy Reading Texts" for 1st and 2nd year students and "Reading Texts" for 3rd and 4th year students tend to be dictated at around 100 WPM.

- [www.stenolife.com](https://www.stenolife.com/index.php/site/dictation/index)

   Many short pieces are available across a wide range of speeds. Making an account is required.

   A repository with longer pieces and guided practice sessions. Making an account is required.

## Volunteer Projects Needing Transcription

- [Library of Congress By the People Project](https://crowd.loc.gov/)

   Volunteer project transcribing historical texts.
 
## Flashcard decks


- [Steno3000](http://stenoknight.com/w/images/Steno3000.anki)

    An [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) flash card deck has been created to help review the the 3000 most common English words as a flash card deck. Going through these basic flash cards is one way to become familiar with which strokes correspond to which sounds or letters, and to briefs in general. Eventually, this can help learners memorize the most basic and common English words.

    The deck is entirely based off the Dictionary included in Plover 2.1.1. It is divided up into levels from 1 to 15, starting at the most common words. On each card, on the front is the common word. Anki gives you a field where you can use Plover to type in the word that you see. Press Enter (or in steno, R-R) and Anki will show you all the briefs that produce the word, starting from the most abbreviated. From there, you can report back to Anki how difficult it was to recall the brief. Anki will schedule the next time that word is shown to you, accordingly.

    The deck also includes briefs for phrases (where each word in the phrase is one of the most common 3000 words).

- An Anki deck with the complete Plover dictionary as flash cards is available [here](https://github.com/percidae/Anki_Plover/releases/)


## Other Typing Sites

Sites not made for steno are not ideal for use with Plover, but they offer good quality practice material for the intermediate stenographer, or to judge your skills with a metric.

- [TypeRacer](http://typeracer.com)

    Online realtime typing competition.
- [10 Fast Fingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)

    Copy practice.

## Materials to Print

When starting to learn the steno layout, you might be using a QWERTY keyboard and you'll need to map between them. It's helpful to have a chart printed in case you get lost.
