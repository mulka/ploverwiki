Stenography was traditionally taught in schools, and still is today. However, because of Open Steno, there are increasingly self-taught stenographers. Plover has everything you need to teach yourself stenography.

# Learning Resources

## Tutorial / Textbook

These sites aim to teach you steno, from the layout to the terminology to the strokes.
