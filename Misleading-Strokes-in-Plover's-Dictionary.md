There are some misstroke entries in the Plover dictionary that are very nice (and short) but may cause issues later on, such as with word boundaries.

### And

The recommended stroke for "and" is `SKP` which is arbitrarily chosen as it is comfortable and there is little chance of a word boundary issue. There are some other strokes in the dictionary but they are only to serve as a phonetic alternative under pressure, as "and" is a common word ending.

### Con- word

In Plover's theory, it is recommended to use `KAUPB` to start words beginning with con, and `KOPB` should only be used for the word "con". However, when you look up a con word in Plover, it will only return misstrokes that contain the `KOPB` stroke because the prefix doesn't require a dictionary entry.

For example, use `KAUPB/TAEUPB`, not `KOPB/TAEUPB`.

Other words are not easy to write phonetically because they are to be briefed, such as `T-PB → continue`.

### Hyphen (-)

Mirabai strokes `H-PB`, which is `H-N` for hyphen. There is a set of misstrokes that use `H-B` instead, which is okay to use.

### Was

Best stroked `WAS` or `WAZ`. The default dictionary has `WA → was`, which is most of the time all right. However it can conflict in some cases, like `WA/TKPWOPB → wagon (not "was gone")` and `WA/TPHA/SA → wanna sa (not "was NASA")`.

### Your

Best stroked `KWROUR`, not `KWRUR`, as `KWRUR` is a word ending. For example, `KHROES/KWRUR → closure` versus `KHROES/KWROUR → close your`.
