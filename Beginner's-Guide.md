### Install Plover

Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases/latest). On Mac OS you will need to enable [Assistive Device Permissions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202866) each time you install Plover (`System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`), and other "keyboard helper" type applications (like Karabiner Elements) may interfere with Plover. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Installation-Guide#installation) for other instructions.

### Try it out

By default, Plover will use your keyboard as input. Steno often needs you to press many keys at once, and most keyboards won't handle that, but you can still write quite a few words. Run Plover and click the `Enable` radio button. Move your fingers up from the home row so that they rest on the cracks between the keys, and move your thumbs up so they rest on the cracks between `C`/`V` and `N`/`M`. Try out these [sentences that (mostly) only need two keys at once](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/two-key). You may like to go into Plover's `Configure > Display` settings and turn on either the stroke display or the suggestions window.

### Get a better input device

Steno routinely requires you to press five or six keys at once, and some chords may require as many as 16. So before long you'll need something more than a basic keyboard. Here are some options, or you can look at the [[Supported Hardware]] page for a longer list.

* An N-key Rollover (NKRO) keyboard is specially designed to allow pressing many keys at once. Some have the normal staggered rows, while others use an "ortholinear" layout with the keys in straight columns. This is handy for steno, as you often press two keys in a column with a single finger. In either case, you can get laser-cut keytoppers from the [Plover Store](http://plover.deco-craft.com/) and stick them on the keys with double-stick tape. YMMV: some people swear by these, others don't like them much.
    * The [Zalman ZM-K600S](https://www.amazon.com/Zalman-Unlimited-Multi-Key-keyboard-ZM-K600S/dp/B0196J3IPE) is currently the cheapest option in the US, at $45-50.
    * The [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) is a fairly high-end keybeard at $200, but has an ortholinear layout, has two separate halves so you can angle them to suit you, and can be ordered with the Gateron White keys which are nice and light at a mere 35 gram activation force.
    * I've heard good things about the [Planck](http://olkb.com/planck/) keyboard as well, but I believe it's only available occasionally on Massdrop?

* Various steno enthusiasts are making and selling machines designed for use with Plover.
    * The [Stenomod](http://stenomod.blogspot.com/) is perhaps the most highly recommended of these, with its nice light keys and split design. Plover lead dev Ted Morin [wrote an excellent review](http://www.teds.space/2016/10/stenomod-affordable-steno-machine.html).
    * The [SOFT/HRUF](https://softhruf.love/) is cheaper, lighter, and many people like it nearly as well. Ellis Pratt wrote a [review comparing it with the Stenomod](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ploversteno/iraOYarRbdg/tlHeagOQGQAJ).

* You can also find used steno machines on eBay at reasonable prices ($200-$500-ish?). The most common/popular of these seems to be the Stentura 400 SRT.


### Practice, practice, practice

While there are many competing steno theories for the English language (Magnum, Phoenix, etc.) they all share the same keyboard design and basic method of representing the sounds. They differ mostly in the details of how they abbreviate words, and how many abbreviations they use. And everyone ends up adapting them and forming a personal style anyway.

So you don't need to worry about choosing a theory until you hit 100 WPM or so. It's fine to start with Plover's middle-of-the-road StenEd-based theory. After 3-6 months you'll have a better feel for things and you can start experimenting with different theories.

Plover has an excellent introductory textbook, [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/home), and [Steno Jig](https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/) lets you drill on the exercises. [[Learning Resources]] and [the old steno practice page](http://stenoknight.com/wiki/Practice) list other tools.
