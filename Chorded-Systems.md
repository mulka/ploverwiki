A chorded system, or *system* for short, is a set of rules for Plover that determines the keys, language rules, and default dictionaries in Plover. **System Plugins** allow Plover to support different machine types and languages other than English.

The [American Ward-Ireland Stone Stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) is the default layout in Plover, and what we teach and recommend by default. However, there are many different chorded systems worldwide and some of them have been implemented in Plover.

## English

### English Stenotype

The default system in Plover. Used internationally for English-language transcription, invented in the United States in 1913.

### Possum Palantype

The [Possum Palantype](http://www.openstenoproject.org/palantype) is a system invented in the UK which was optimized to have readable shorthand notes (the untranslated output). It has more keys than the Ireland layout. It is still used by some [STTRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-to-text_reporter) worldwide for writing in English.

Available as a plugin in Plover 4+ through the Plugins Manager: [plover-palantype](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plover-palantype)

## Italian

### Michela

Used by the Italian Senate. A cheap alternative to an official Michela machine is any MIDI keyboard.
