A chorded system, or *system* for short, is a set of rules for Plover that determines the keys, language rules, and default dictionaries in Plover. **System Plugins** allow Plover to support different machine types and languages other than English.

The [American Ward-Ireland Stone Stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) is the default layout in Plover, and what we teach and recommend by default. However, there are many different chorded systems worldwide and some of them have been implemented in Plover.

### Legend

- ✅ Available for Plover
- 🚧 In Development
- ❌ Not in Development

## English

### ✅English Stenotype

The default system in Plover. Used internationally for English-language transcription, invented in the United States in 1913.

### ✅Possum Palantype

The [Possum Palantype](http://www.openstenoproject.org/palantype) is a system invented in the UK which was optimized to have readable shorthand notes (the untranslated output). It has more keys than the Ireland layout. It is still used by some [STTRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-to-text_reporter) worldwide for writing in English.

Available as a plugin in Plover 4+ through the Plugins Manager: [plover-palantype](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plover-palantype)

## Italian

### ✅Michela

Used by the Italian Senate. Both the phonetic and the orthographic theory are available. A cheap alternative to an official Michela machine is any MIDI keyboard.

Free theory books are available [here](https://sillabix.gitbooks.io/dizionario-test/) and [here](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/sillabix/dizionario-ortografico-michela-per-input-sillabic/details).

### 🚧Melani

An orthographic theory for Italian writing based on the Tréal machine. Development currently in progress.

## Korean

### 🚧CAS

The Computer Aided Steno-machine, or CAS, was developed by [Korea Steno](http://www.koreasteno.com/) and features one of the two modern stenography systems for Korean in use today.

The CAS system is currently under development as a plugin in [plover-korean](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean).

### ❌Sorizava

Sorizava, developed by [a company of the same name](http://www.sorizava.co.kr/), is the second of the modern stenography systems for Korean in use today and the more recent to have been created.

The Sorizava system is not currently under development. There are partial pieces of an implementation in [plover-korean](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean) but outside of a partial dictionary no theory materials have been obtained to progress further.

## Portuguese

### ✅Brazilian Stenotype

Used by [Paulo Paniago](http://openstenoblog.blogspot.ca/2015/04/my-experience-in-open-source.html). No public dictionary currently available.
