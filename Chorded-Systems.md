A chorded system, or *system* for short, is a set of rules for Plover that determines the keys, language rules, and default dictionaries in Plover. **System Plugins** allow Plover to support different machine types and languages other than English.

The [American Ward-Ireland Stone Stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) is the default layout in Plover, and what we teach and recommend by default. However, there are many different chorded systems worldwide and some of them have been implemented in Plover.

## English

### English Stenotype ‚úÖ

The default system in Plover. Used internationally for English-language transcription, invented in the United States in 1913.

### Possum Palantype ‚úÖ

The [Possum Palantype](http://www.openstenoproject.org/palantype) is a system invented in the UK which was optimized to have readable shorthand notes (the untranslated output). It has more keys than the Ireland layout. It is still used by some [STTRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-to-text_reporter) worldwide for writing in English.

Available as a plugin in Plover 4+ through the Plugins Manager: [plover-palantype](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plover-palantype)

## Italian

### Michela ‚úÖ

Used by the Italian Senate. A cheap alternative to an official Michela machine is any MIDI keyboard.

[Free theory book](https://sillabix.gitbooks.io/dizionario-test/) available.

### Melani üöß

An orthographic theory for Italian writing based on the Tr√©al machine. Development currently in progress.

## Korean

### CAS üöß

The Computer Aided Steno-machine, or CAS, features one of the two modern stenography systems for Korean in use today. Developed by [Korea Steno](http://www.koreasteno.com/), the system is composed of a number row, two rows of 5 consonants for each hand with each hand containing the same keys, and a row of 5 vowels that also contains an asterisk key similar in use to the [English Stenotype](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Chorded-Systems#english-stenotype).

The CAS system is currently under development as a plugin in [plover-korean](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean).

### Sorizava ‚ùå

Sorizava, developed by [a company of the same name](http://www.sorizava.co.kr/), is the second of the modern stenography systems for Korean in use today. The Sorizava system contains more keys than the [CAS system](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Chorded-Systems#cas) with a number row, 3 rows of 5 consonants for each hand, a row of 6 vowels, and a space key. The additional keys are mostly used for having dedicated aspirated and tensed consonant keys and unlike the [CAS system](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Chorded-Systems#cas) the consonants on each hand are not identical - one hand even contains a complex vowel key.

The Sorizava system is not currently under development. There are partial pieces of an implementation in [plover-korean](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean) but outside of a dictionary no theory materials have been obtained to progress further.

## Portuguese

### Brazilian Stenotype ‚úÖ

Used by [Paulo Paniago](http://openstenoblog.blogspot.ca/2015/04/my-experience-in-open-source.html). No public dictionary currently available.

Available as a plugin in Plover 4+ through the Plugins Manager: [plover-portuguese](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plover-portuguese)

## Russian

### Trillo ‚úÖ

A realtime theory for Russian writing based on the Tr√©al machine.
