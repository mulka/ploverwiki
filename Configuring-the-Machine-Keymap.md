**Configure ➪ Machine ➪ Keymap**

You can remap how Plover handles keys on your machine.

The available options are affected by your system and the machine you are using.

Remapping keys is especially useful when using your Keyboard as a steno machine, as you may want to set keys to "no-op" which will disable that key while Plover is running.

The `Key` column enumerates every key that Plover can control on your machine. This is a list of all keys on the keyboard. For American steno machines, the key names will be the Ireland layout defaults (S, T, K, etc.)

The `Action` column is what you'd like Plover to see when the key is pressed. The available actions will change depending on which system (e.g. English Stenotype) you have enabled.
