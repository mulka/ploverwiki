Converting a normal keyboard (staggered NKRO-QWERTY) to a dedicated Plover-keyboard

Performed on a LionCast Gaming Keyboard LK10

## Equipment
### Most is optional

* Plover
* Keyboard
* Plastic baggies
* Something to rip [keycaps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keycap] off the keyboard (can be 3D-printed)
* Label maker
* Blue tack Skoletyggis
Take picture of keyboard to know where keys used to be
Use Plover to find out which keys are used, and which ones aren't
Pluck off the keys in the Steno layout:
#STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ - except for F
And yes, there's probably only a single S, T, P on your keyboard.
Put them to the side
Pluck off semicolon, colon, hyphen, asterisk, or similar
Put those to the side as well
Leave these keys in place: numbers (0-9), F, J, up-arrow, down-arrow. Pluck off the remaining ones, putting them into 3 piles: letter keys, irregular shapes, and the rest.
I left the up- and down-arrow keys on because they can be used to navigate Plover's paper tape.
F and J are the ones with bumps.
Check if you can use a non-bumpy key in place of F and J
If you can: put F to the side, and J in the letter key pile. If not: leave both in their places
Replace 6 with # - Reminder that it's the number row, and where the center is.
Put the asterisk in the lower right corner of the group of 4 keys for *, and semikolon and the rest in the other 3. Test that they're in the correct places using Plover
Put the keys there is only one letter of, where they belong
Decide where to put S, T and P. I put them up left
Put keys on the rest. Whichever suit you. I chose C for the other S on the left, for instance.
Use masking tape to tape over the gaps where ESC, F-keys, Home/Insert etc., numpad and arrowkeys were to reduce dust buildup
Start practising with Qwerty-steno, and notice that the bottom 4 keys are pointy and uncomfortable
